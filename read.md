# Advanced Web Development Course

The following repo contains code related to the Advanced Web Development 
Course, found at https://udemy.com/course/the-advanced-web-developer-bootcamp/.

Each section will be broken up into its own root folder, with folders separating 
each lesion. Each lesion folder will be titled with the lesion number corresponding
with the course. Code spanning multiple lesions will be copied over to reflect the
changes made over the span of multiple lesions.

Each section will contains a notes.md file which will contain notes taken for each lesion.

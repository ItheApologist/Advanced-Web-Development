A repo for my Advanced Web Dev course on Udemey

Each section will contain a notes.md file at the root folder. Since many videos in a section cover the same topic, I noticed it was wasteful to create copies of the lesion before only to add a few lines of notes to the MD file. Further, having accessability to those notes became a chore. Now, each section will have one notes file with all the notes from that section creating less clutter and easier accessability to myself.
